Wemos D1mini and DHT22 control relay for Bathroomfan

Trying to make a relative humidity controlled bathroom fan.. Using a Wemos D1mini, DHT22, and a relay
Found the Blynk app and used it to check and put it in a graph on my iphone..

Part 2 would be to control/override it with a virtual button in the Blynk app

Or would someone have a better idea or solution to Blynk?
